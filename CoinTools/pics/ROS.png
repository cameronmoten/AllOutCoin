Modern fractional banking has not kept up with technology, payments are slow taking days to settle and very very expensive. Ripple ( the technology) was created to enable banks to transfer currency quickly and inexpensively using blockchain technology. Using the Ripple technology alone can save banks approximately 30% of transaction costs..some of .these saving hopefully will be passed on to the consumer. ( Ripple,2017)<br/><br/>In order for banks to facilitate payments, each bank must have a &quot;Nostro accounts&quot;, these are accounts at corresponding banks in the various currencies. For example, Bank A must have an account at Bank B in all of the various foreign currencies it wishes to exchange for customers, this is very expensive for the bank, these fiat amounts sit idle and do not earn any interest for the bank. Now multiply these accounts by the number of banks and financial institutions globally.... trillions of dollars are sitting in these Nostro accounts.  This is where Ripples XRP comes into play, XRP allows any currency, USD, CAD, AUD, Euro, Peso etc to be used for payment transfers, eliminating the banks need to fund Nostro accounts! Why is this important...banks can now lend this previously useless cash into the market earning interest...furthermore because of fractional banking, banks can lend this cash out up to nine times... yes nine times per unit, dollar etc! You can see why banks would want to free up this cash.  <br/><br/>Payments require &quot;liquidity&quot;, liquidity is the ability for the bank to have cash available on demand without having to sell an asset, XRP fills this void for the banks and FI ( Financial Institutions). Banks can now use XRP as the liquidity tool in making payment, furthermore, these XRp can be reused over and over again by the banks, ( although a very small amount of xrp is destroyed per transaction) as they send payments globally. <br/><br/>The US Commerce Department( UD Dept of Commerce 2017) estimates that the global  SWIFT ( Swift is the current global transfer system)payments are 1.24 trillion-dollar per year industry, this does not include retail payments such as Visa, Master Card, Amex, JCB, Paypal and various other Apps. Nor does this include checks and ACh payments.... the market is truly massive.  Moreover, the Swift system takes up to 7 business days to settle a transaction and has a high failure rate ( Ripple 2017)! This means that in some cases companies and banks are without the funds as they are intransit...somewhere in the system. Take a look at you Visa... make a payment...although you get credit for the payment the day you make it the payment does nor show on your Visa for 1-3 days...something with Swift. Ripple XRP can be settled in 4 seconds and can currently handle thousands of transactions per second...this lightning speed will create &quot;Velocity of money&quot; for banks and consumers, allowing money real cash to be used for more purposes which should help push the economy forward. <br/><br/>BTW, the big financial institutions will not be running to the retail exchanges to buy XRP, they will buy in bulk at a discount directly from Ripple HQ, that being said these purchases will drive the price..as consumers/investors will see this a sign of adoption rate.<br/><br/>On the XRP forum, I see many peeps talking about &quot;Market Cap&quot; ...stop this it means nothing, Market Cap is simply the price of a share or coin multiplied by the total outstanding shares or coins. Does the market cap of the USD or Euro mean anything... nope! Market Cap in currencies is a useless metric, what you should e focusing on is adoption rate and the intrinsic value of the XRP. <br/><br/> Furthermore many statements are made about exchanges quoting different prices, while true the explanation is simple. First please get in the habit of referring to the XRP pair against your home currency or USD, do not compare to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not stable and can distort percent gains or losses of XRP. Many Asian exchanges charge a % premium to the actual price of the XRP. The cryptocurrency market is not fully integrated yet like the fiat Forex system is.... so at times you will have lag time and other factors such as demand, holidays and &quot;information asymmetry&quot; which can cause differing prices. Do not worry though most exchanges catch up quickly...if this was not the case we would see arbitrage! ( for definition https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/041504.asp)<br/><br/>Ever wonder why the price shy rockets only to come tumbling down ?? This is caused by a number of factors including supply and demand, the release of news and importantly peeps not using limit orders. When you place a market order the exchanges fill the order at any price... which can cause a run on the price. limit orders are set prices that you would like to buy and sell at, these types of orders can help to keep the market stable. Generally, my experience has been that peeps who are fearful will use market orders to get out of the position, while this may seem the right thing to do, market orders can trigger stop losses orders which cause massive declines. The same happens in the opposite direction, peeps who are greedy place market orders pushing the price massively higher, only to see profit takers come in and push the price down. I use limit orders only!<br/><br/>I am a long-term holder of XRP and do not plan on selling any for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>This is the first in a series of posts that I will be making about Ripple, XRP, and cryptocurrencies in general.
